    "\n",
    "1. **Products/Services**\n",
    "   - **Why Useful**: These pages detail what the company offers to customers. Evaluate whether their offerings are user-friendly, scalable, and aligned with current trends.\n",
    "   - **Potential Indicators**:\n",
    "     - Missing features that competitors provide.\n",
    "     - Outdated product interfaces or designs.\n",
    "     - No clear differentiation in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Careers**\n",
    "   - **Why Useful**: These pages reveal the company's hiring trends and skillset needs. They can highlight gaps in expertise or technological capabilities.\n",
    "   - **Potential Indicators**:\n",
    "     - Active hiring for IT roles, indicating unmet technical needs.\n",
    "     - Lack of roles focused on modern technologies (e.g., AI, cloud computing).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contact**\n",
    "   - **Why Useful**: These pages often reveal how the company handles customer interactions and inquiries.\n",
    "   - **Potential Indicators**:\n",
    "     - Lack of automation (e.g., no chatbots, basic forms).\n",
    "     - Inefficient customer support systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **About/Company Info**\n",
    "   - **Why Useful**: Offers insights into the company's goals, culture, and long-term strategies.\n",
    "   - **Potential Indicators**:\n",
    "     - Lack of emphasis on digital transformation or outdated mission statements.\n",
    "     - Areas where improved tech integration could support their goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Case Studies/Blog/Portfolio**\n",
    "   - **Why Useful**: These pages show the company's achievements and projects.\n",
